# CS Mini Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my hands-on Computer Science mini projects.  
I focus on learning by **building, testing, and analyzing failures** to understand concepts deeply.

## Projects Included

### Algorithms
- **Binary Search – Edge Case Exploration**  
  Tests how algorithms behave under edge cases and why assumptions matter.

### Data Structures
- **Custom Hash Table**  
  Implements a hash table with collision handling, showing design trade-offs.

### Security
- **Password Strength Checker**  
  Validates passwords and tests edge cases for security compliance.

*(More projects coming soon in AI, Systems, and Cybersecurity)*
